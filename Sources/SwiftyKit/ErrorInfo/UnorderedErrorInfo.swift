/// [String: Any] || Unordered Type has one benefit prior to Ordered / Sorted Dictionary â€“ keys have different order.
/// if logging system has strong limit on number of key-value pairs can be logged and drops ones that out of limit, it is not so big problem when keys have different order.
/// Each log in such situation will have different key-value pairs,  though not full. From this mosaic a valuable picture of problem can be restored.
